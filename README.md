## Hi there 👋

My name is Krisjen Fraulein Hutagalung, but you can call me Ijen. I'm an undergraduate data science student at UNESA and currently rolling on Asah Dicoding with learning path Front-End and Back-End with AI. 

🤔 I’m looking for help with my journey to become a fully equipped data science. Please reach out to me if you feel the same thing as me. I'd love to have some companion. You can reach me through my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/krisjen-fraulein-hutagalung-aa3723239) or my [gmail](krisjenfraulein23@gmail.com).

⚡ Ah, a little fun fact about me, i love to draw.
